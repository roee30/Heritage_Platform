(* The problem is to find the lexical entry, if any, that matches a stem
   and an etymology, corresponding to the morphological structure of a
   generated stem. For instance entry "k.rta" has etymology pp(k.r\#1). 
   It does not produce forms, and is skipped by the morphology generator,
   since the pp participal stem is a productive taddhita construction,
   that will indeed generate stem k.rta from its root k.r1.
   The problem for the morphology generator is to display forms of k.rta
   with a link to k.rta in the hypertext lexicon. It is non-trivial, since
   homonymies occur. Thus homophony indexes associated with generators
   and consistent with possible lexicalizations must be registered.
   A first pass of recording builds [lexical_kridantas] as a [deco_krid] deco
   indexing the stems with a pair (morphology,homo). Then the morphology
   generator from Inflected extends it as [unique_kridantas], accessed as
   [Inflected.acccess_krid] and [Inflected.register_krid], and used
   by [Parts.gen_stem]. *)
