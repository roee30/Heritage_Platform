**************************************************
* Installation of the Sanskrit Heritage Platform *
**************************************************

The following instructions concern installation of the Sanskrit Heritage Platform
on a UNIX platform, either on Apple Mac or on versions of Linux such as Ubuntu.
The system may also be installed on a Windows 11 station, please see the README
in directory WINDOW_INSTALLATION, courtesy of Pitchumani Srinivasan. 

A. Generalities

This library is developed on Unix/Linux, whereas the end product (Sanskrit 
Platform) may run on any Web server. 
UNIX tools such as make, tar, sed and gcc are assumed to exist.
We also assume that python and the git revision control system have been
installed (they are pre-installed in most modern operating systems).
Finally, we assume that a Web server such as Apache has been installed. 
Most modern operating systems also provide a local Web server, allowing
management of localhost Web sites. You'll need su privilege in order to
install the site. 

Installation assumes prior installation of Objective Caml available
from site http://ocaml.org. The distribution version
4.07 ought to be used, available at "http://ocaml.org/releases/".

The proper sequence of commands is:
./configure
make world.opt
sudo make install

Then install package Ocamlbuild from https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/releases
for instance OCamlbuild 0.12.0:
make configure # beware: not ./configure
make
sudo make install

Then install Camlp4 from GitHub, in the 4.07 branch, available from
https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4/releases; take for instance 4.07+1. 
This should be installed by:
./configure
make all # beware: not just make
sudo make install

The following instructions assume installation under some version of the 
Unix operating system, such as FreeBSD, Linux or MacOSX. 
They may also apply to versions of Windows under the Cigwin emulator, 
but this has not been tested.

The Sanskrit Heritage Platform, implemented as a set of Web services,
uses a separate package Heritage_resources that defines the Sanskrit
linguistic data necessary for its operation. It also uses the Zen
computational linguistics Ocaml library.
These packages may be pulled as Git packages. 

Create a clean installation directory HERITAGE, where you run successively:
git clone git@gitlab.inria.fr/huet/Zen.git
git clone -b development git@gitlab.inria.fr/huet/Heritage_Resources.git
git clone -b development git@gitlab.inria.fr/huet/Heritage_Platform.git
This will create three sub_directories, namely Zen, Heritage_Resources
and Heritage_Platform in their current stable versions.

B. Sanskrit Platform installation.

This means installing a local mirror Web site of Sanskrit_platform.

1. Configuration

First the user should define a configuration file config in the
directory SETUP. He should imitate the format of examples such as
config.amrita.txt (local host) and config.sanskrit.txt (public server). 

We assume that the installer is logged on the HTTP server, or at least
on a machine of the same architecture and system, and that he has proper
access rights. Let "Main" be the installation directory 
(normally the parent of the SETUP directory where resides
this README file). Let "host" be your hostname or any label of your choosing.
Go to subdirectory SETUP, and edit file config.txt
for customization, as follows. 

ZENDIR is the UNIX path to the subdirectory ML of the Zen library.
So it should be of the form '.../Zen/ML/'.

PLATFORM is a customization parameter of the HTTP server platform
and of the HTML client browser target. Currently it can take values:
* 'Computer' or 'Server' for Internet server
* 'Station' for client user on localhost

TRANSLIT should indicate the default input transliteration scheme. Currently are 
supported:
'VH' Velthuis' scheme with Huet's additions
'KH' Kyoto-Harvard
'SL' Sanskrit Library (SLP1)
'WX' from Univ. of Hyderabad
But you may also input Unicode strings (encoded in format UTF-8) if you choose:
'DN' Devanagari
'RN' Indic romanization with diacritics according to the IAST standard. 

LEXICON indicates the reference default lexicon: 
'SH' for the Sanskrit Heritage dictionary in French 
'MW' for the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary.

DISPLAY is the default font for Sanskrit text output: 
'roma' for romanisation, 
or 'deva' for devanagarii.

SERVERHOST should be the domain name (or IP address) of the target HTTP server.
For instance, use SERVERHOST='127.0.0.1' for localhost service
(SERVERHOST='localhost' should work too). 

SERVERPUBLICDIR should be the absolute path on the server file system of the data
to be used by its cgi-bin executables - it should be allowed as readable from 
all. The fields of the configuration file relevant to the Apache server
should be consistent with its own configuration. In case of doubt, look
for Apache's configuration file, called httpd.conf. The directory where
HTML documents are found is named DocumentRoot. A good practice is
to declare SERVERPUBLICDIR as a subdirectory of DocumentRoot (created in
super-user mode). Thus, if DocumentRoot is /var/www/html, as in many Linux
installations, declare SERVERPUBLICDIR as /var/www/html/Heritage_Platform. 

# IMPORTANT: in SERVERPUBLICDIR as well as CGIDIR below, you must plan on
# creating the directories in the Apache area /var/www, in supervisor mode

SKTDIRURL should be its local url on the server - typically a relative address 
in the httpd area such as /Heritage_Platform/
or possibly a readable sub-directory of user's xxx public_html directory  
such as /~xxx/Heritage_Platform/. This parameter should always start with
"/" so that it is recognized as a subpath in the local server data directory.

CGIDIR should be the absolute path on the server file system of its CGI 
executables, typically on Linux /var/www/cgi-bin/ (or some other directory 
indicated as possibly containing cgis in Apache's configuration file).

CGIBINURL is the corresponding URL, such as '/cgi-bin/Heritage_Platform/'

CGIEXT is the extension of cgi executables,
if needed by the Apache configuration.

MOUSEACTION controls the morphology printing of the
interface segments. It may be 'CLICK' or 'OVER'.

CAPTION is the localisation message on the site entry page.

SKTRESOURCES is the local path to the distribution directory where
the Heritage_Resources linguistic data have been installed.

When the config file is ready, store it in directory SETUP, then execute
in directory Main the command
./configure 

The localization is complete. More complex localizations may be obtained by changes of
the MMakefile in directory SETUP, which is the Makefile source template. 
For instance, if you want to change the standard names of the cgis generated as 
Sanskrit engine tools, you have to read the following.

The various cgi-bin executables will be installed 
in CGIDIR under names declared as respectively
CGIINDEX, CGIINDEXD, CGIDECL, CGICONJ, CGILEMMA, CGIREADER, CGIPARSER, CGITAGGER,
CGISANDHI, CGIGRAPH and CGIUSER. 

2. Elaboration of the services

This is simply achieved by command:
make

This compiles the Zen linguistic platform, together with the various 
Web services of the platform. It may take a few minutes to build the necessary 
linguistic resources. 

3. Installation

If Apache is not currently running on your station, you should start
it with "sudo httpd -k start", and consider putting this command
in the scheduling initialisation file of your operating system (crontable).

At this point, make sure that the directories SERVERPUBLICDIR and CGIDIR
exists on the server, or create them in supervisor mode. 

Then execute:
        sudo make install
This installs the executables and their data on the server. 

This concludes the installation of the SKT Platform. 
Try the web site by browsing http://SERVERHOST/SKTDIRURL

N.B. You may run into security problems preventing you from running the CGI
services. This may be due to security concerns, with an overly cautious
configuration of Apache. This may be corrected by editing Apache's configuration,
a complex and risky operation. For instance, check that your httpd.conf
configuration file has an uncommented line:
LoadModule cgi_module ...

Another route is to install the software with XAMPP, an open-source 
lightweight Apache distribution that makes it easier for developers 
to install a local web server. Another possible replacement for Apache
is the MAMP package.
